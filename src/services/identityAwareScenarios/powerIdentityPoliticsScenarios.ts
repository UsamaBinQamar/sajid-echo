    scenario_setup: "You're standing in the hotel bar after the first day of the industry's biggest conference. Around you, executives are laughing over drinks, making connections that turn into partnerships, job offers, and opportunities. You know this is where the real business happens—not in the conference rooms, but in these informal moments. But as you scan the room, you count maybe three other Black professionals among the 200+ people networking. You've been to enough of these events to know the pattern: polite conversations that don't lead anywhere, being mistaken for catering staff, or being the go-to person when someone wants to discuss diversity initiatives. Your colleague Rebecca approaches with a drink in hand and someone in tow.",
    initial_situation: "Rebecca beams as she walks over. 'I want you to meet David Chen, VP of Strategic Partnerships at Morrison Tech. David, this is Alex—one of our most innovative leaders!' David extends his hand with a practiced networking smile, and you can almost see him processing: networking opportunity or diversity conversation? You've been in this moment countless times, knowing that how you navigate the next few minutes could determine whether you're seen as a strategic partner or a checkbox.",

Your technical background is solid, your team leadership experience is excellent, and the feedback from the engineering teams has been overwhelmingly positive. But when the Chief People Officer walks in instead of the CTO, you feel a familiar sinking sensation. She sits down with a smile that's meant to be encouraging but somehow feels apologetic.",

We're creating a new position—Director of Engineering Diversity and Inclusion. It would report directly to me, and you'd have budget, visibility, and real impact on our hiring and culture initiatives.' She pauses, clearly expecting enthusiasm.

But as the room fills with side conversations and casual laughter, something settles in your chest. You see circles forming—but not opening. You catch the quick glances, the unspoken cues, the introductions you're left out of. There's no official exclusion. Nothing you can point to. But the message is clear: the real decisions, the real access, the unspoken alliances—those live somewhere behind closed doors you haven't been invited to.",
    initial_situation: "You're standing near the coffee station, watching a group of executives laugh at something one of them just said. They're clearly in the middle of an animated discussion about some strategic initiative. You recognize two of them from the leadership team, and you know this is exactly the kind of conversation you should be part of. But as you approach with your coffee, the energy shifts subtly. The conversation doesn't stop, but it feels... closed. One of them—a senior director you've worked with before—notices you and offers a polite smile.",
