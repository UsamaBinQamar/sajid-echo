    scenario_setup: "Three months into your new role as Director of Product Strategy, you're walking back from a leadership meeting where you presented your quarterly roadmap. The presentation went well—your ideas were solid, your data was thorough, and the executives nodded approvingly. But afterwards, as you're gathering your things, you overhear two senior VPs talking in the hallway: 'Smart hire, very articulate.' The word 'articulate' hits you like a subtle punch. You've heard it before, always delivered as a compliment that somehow doesn't feel like one. Now you're back in your office, and your direct report Jordan is waiting for your weekly one-on-one.",
    initial_situation: "Jordan settles into the chair across from your desk with their usual energy. 'How did the leadership meeting go? I heard you were presenting the roadmap.' But instead of celebrating the successful presentation, you find yourself wondering: Do they see me as their leader, or as someone who was hired to check boxes? The question you've been avoiding sits heavy in your chest: Am I actually qualified for this role, or am I here because of what I represent rather than what I can do?",

    scenario_setup: "You're in your office after the Monday team meeting, where you presented the quarterly results with your usual professional demeanor—measured, articulate, careful. The presentation went well, but you're exhausted from the constant self-monitoring: moderating your tone, choosing your words carefully, making sure your passion doesn't come across as 'aggressive' or 'emotional.' Later this week, you're supposed to speak to the company's emerging leaders group about authentic leadership. The irony isn't lost on you. Your team member Samantha knocks and pokes her head in.",
    initial_situation: "Samantha enters with a curious expression. 'Hey, I wanted to ask you something. I was talking to my friend who works at TechFlow, and she mentioned seeing you speak at that conference last year. She said you were completely different—more animated, funnier, really passionate. She couldn't believe you were the same person.' Samantha sits down, genuinely curious. 'I mean, you're great here, but... do you feel like you can really be yourself at work? I've been thinking about this whole authentic leadership thing, and I'm wondering how you navigate it.'",

    scenario_setup: "You've recently stepped into a new leadership position—one that you've worked hard to earn. The title is new. The expectations are high. You've been sitting in meetings where everything sounds familiar but nothing feels grounded yet. People assume you're confident, capable, ready to take the reins. And you are—but quietly, you've been wondering how to actually lead well here. You haven't been offered a mentor or roadmap. There's no orientation. Just praise and pressure. You think about reaching out to someone to ask for help or guidance, but a voice inside you hesitates. You don't want to seem like you weren't ready. You don't want anyone to think they made a mistake choosing you. And if you're honest, you've been the first or the only enough times to know that asking for help sometimes costs more than it gives.",
    initial_situation: "You're sitting in your office, about to email someone you admire in the organization. Or maybe you're walking into a one-on-one with your supervisor. The moment before you speak—your mind is full of what you need, what you fear, and what might shift if you ask. Your supervisor settles across from you with their usual checking-in energy. 'How are you settling into the role? Everything going smoothly?' But you can hear the real question underneath: Are you handling this? The space to be vulnerable feels both necessary and dangerous.",
